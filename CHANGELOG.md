# 0.15.79-alpha (2023-01-20 / 2b06d8e)

## Added

## Changed

- Dependency version bumps

# 0.14.72-alpha (2022-12-12 / 06eed64)

## Added

- Add support for top-level shadow-cljs config/builds, not only sub-project builds

## Fixed

- Better handle `:paths` in `deps.local.edn`, ensure they are picked up at boot,
  not only at first classpath reload

# 0.13.67-alpha (2022-11-25 / 07ac499)

## Added

- Support setting :lauchpad/main-opts in .clojure/deps.edn

# 0.12.64-alpha (2022-10-26 / a4fdb16)

## Added

- Write the current classpath to `.cpcache/launchpad.cp`, for integrating third
  parties like clojure-lsp. (configure `cat .cpache/launchpad.cp` as your
  `:classpath-cmd`)
- Call `(user/go)` in a `try/catch`
- Start the watcher on a separate thread, it can take a long time to boot, and
  meanwhile we shouldn't block REPL startup.

## Fixed

- Pick up any `:deps` from `deps.local.edn` at startup, not at the first
  classpath reload
  
## Changed

- Disable directory-watcher file hashing, it gets prohibitively slow

# 0.11.59-alpha (2022-10-21 / 8454771)

## Fixed

- Fixes cljdoc build. There should be no changes to launchpad users.

# 0.9.49-alpha (2022-10-12 / d0123fe)

## Fixed

- Couple the lifetime of the Clojure process to the lifetime of launchpad, exit
  launchpad when the process dies, and kill the process when launchpad exits

# 0.8.46-alpha (2022-10-07 / 4c68918)

## Fixed

- Fixed some of the watching behavior
- Watch files even if they don't yet exist (pick up when they get created)
- Better deal with `:aliases {...}` in `deps.local.edn`
- Clean up output

- `--go` flag, automatically call `(user/go)`

# 0.4.29-alpha (2022-09-22 / 3ce3eb7)
